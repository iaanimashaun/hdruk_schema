As such, there is a healthy volunteer effect that results in participants tending to be of higher socioeconomic status, remaining in education longer, slimmer, less smokers (although those that smoke tend to be heavier smokers) and lower consumers of alcohol than the general population. A comparison between UK Biobank participants and the general UK population has been published (https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx246).

Whilst selection biases are seen in UK Biobank, there is still substantial heterogeneity within the cohort. Whilst incidence and prevalence calculations are not generalisable to the UK population, exposure-outcome comparisons should be due to the heterogeneity in the cohort. However, it is important that researchers consider the potential biases of a data set that might limit generalisability of their results (as is the case for all observational data)."

There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups with Birmingham having a population which is >40% non-white. Birmingham is one of the youngest cities in Europe and has a birth rate that is higher than average (The General Fertility Rate was 69.7 births per thousand population and the Total Fertility Rate was 2.04 children per woman in 2016, both higher than the average for the UK).  Unfortunately Birmingham also has a higher than average infant mortality rate and a higher than average incidence of maternal complications.  There is social deprivation and Birmingham’s population suffers with particularly high rates of physical inactivity, obesity, smoking & diabetes.  There are also high levels of rare diseases, especially immunometabolic conditions.   The patients included in this dataset are representative of this diverse population and also include a wide age-range.    University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.   This dataset includes the patient journey from admission to hospital to outcome for pregnant and post-partum patients admitted to a general hospital. The data includes granular demography and co-morbidity, presenting symptoms and diagnoses, serial physiology and blood biomarkers, all investigations, all prescribed and administered treatments and outcomes.   It can be supplemented with preceding and following health care contacts, to understand the risk for the acute admission during pregnancy and the subsequent impact on health after discharge. Although primarily secondary care, this dataset can be supplemented with ambulance and primary care data on request.

This requires access to both historical data (pre 2020) and near real-time data on patients referred with (i) a suspicion of cancer and (ii) those diagnosed with and/or managed for cancer. Our emphasis is on data on cancer referral, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment and cancer outcomes, examining the impact of age, ethnicity, deprivation, comorbidity and concurrent medication.
 
We will examine the effects of COVID-19 on:
•	Cancer referral (including those which lead to a cancer diagnosis and those where cancer is excluded)
•	Cancer diagnosis (including date, tumour site, stage, grade, morphology and key molecular/genetic/ phenotype)
•	Cancer treatment (including surgical procedures, chemotherapy/targeted therapy and radiotherapy) 
•	Clinical trial activity including recruitment to and active treatment within trials 
•	Outcomes (including both hospital admission, survival, mortality and cause of death)
•	COVID status (including COVID testing (Pillar 1&2) and results, acute hospitalisation and related direct COVID deaths in cancer patients). We will also examine the interaction and impact of other factors including 
•	Age
•	Ethnicity
•	Social deprivation (IMD quintile)
•	Comorbidity (based on both hospital and primary care data) 
•	Concurrent medication (including both hospital and primary care data)
•	Geography including rurality and health care region
