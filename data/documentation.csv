Alongside providing excellent clinical care in the most challenging of environments, there is also a critical need for clinical research to better understand this disease. This will equip us to better deal with the current pandemic as well future ones.

We need to establish why some people develop severe disease and others never get ill despite infection. We need to know whether there are targets for drug development to treat the disease or to give people who are exposed. We will look at genetic influences and immunology (including prior protective viral exposure), seek neutralising antibodies, understand the cellular responses and assess ethnic and sociological factors – all by collecting a biorepository of over 200,000 samples taken from our own healthcare staff weekly over the next 4 months.

25,"Background.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung condition characterised by progressive lung function limitation.   COPD is an umbrella term and encompasses a spectrum of pathophysiologies including chronic bronchitis, small airways disease and emphysema.  COPD caused an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide in 2016, and is estimated to be the third leading cause of death worldwide.  The British Lung Foundation (BLF) estimates that the disease costs the NHS around £1.9 billion per year. COPD is therefore a significant public health challenge.  This dataset explores the impact of hospitalisation in patients with COPD during the COVID pandemic.

Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. 

Supported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma.

• clinical information about surgical indications and operations
• patient information, such as age group and gender
• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used

In July 2010 the A&E data mart was extended further to collect items such as diagnosis, several injury fields and an alcohol involved flag, which will be used to identify whether the patient’s alcohol consumption was a factor in the attendance. The collection of the new fields has been driven by a variety of SG policy decisions and interest from a number of organisations. Although there is now the facility to submit these additional fields, they are still under development and ISD are working with the NHS Boards to support data collection and quality. There are two types of data submitted to the A&E datamart: episode and aggregate level data. All hospitals with Emergency Departments submit episode level data containing a detailed record for each patient attendance. Some smaller sites with minor injury units or community hospitals only submit aggregate files containing monthly summary attendance and compliance figures only. This is because they do not have the information systems and support to enable collection of detailed patient based information. Sites that submit episode level data account for around 94% of all attendances at A&E.",['https://www.hqip.org.uk/a-z-of-nca/dementia-care-in-general-hospitals/'],UKCRC Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre

Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of bespoke data collection to support the NJR . This is submitted to NEC Software Solutions (contracted to the NJR) for processing and is used to monitor the quality and safety of patient care and outcomes. 
This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the NJR research ready data set.
NJR data covers all procedures carried out in NHS and independent sector hospitals  in England, Wales (from 2003), Northern Ireland )from 2013), the Isle of Man (from 2015) and the States of Guernsey (from 2019).
Each NJR record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient treated at an NHS or independent sector hospital, including:
• clinical information about surgical indications and operations
• patient information, such as age group and gender
• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used
• outcomes, such as whether a revision procedure has been undertaken
NJR apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published NJR data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.
Who NJR data is for
NJR can provide data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including:
• national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC
• local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)
• provider organisations
• government departments
• researchers and commercial healthcare bodies
• National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)

The SMS1932 took place simultaneously across schools in Scotland on the 1st of June, 1932, and used the Moray House Test (No. 12; MHT) of general intelligence. Almost every child attending school and born in 1921 (N = 87,498) was tested. The same MHT was administered to almost every child born in 1936 and attending school on the 4th of June, 1947 for the SMS1947 (N = 70,805). Decades later, participants of both Surveys, mostly living in Edinburgh and the surrounding area (the Lothians) in older age, were invited to participate in the Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC) studies. Between 1999 and 2001, 550 of the SMS1932 were recruited to Wave 1 of the LBC1921 study, at a mean age of 79 years. Between 2004 and 2007, 1,091 members of SMS1947 were recruited to Wave 1 of the LBC1936 study, at a mean age of 70 years. Both cohorts re-sat the MHT at initial follow-up. In addition, a large amount of other cognitive, psychosocial, lifestyle, medical, biomarker, genetic, brain imaging and other data were collected. 

The LBC studies set out principally to examine the nature and determinants of non-pathological cognitive ageing from childhood to older age, and within in older age. However, in recent years the scope of the studies has extended to identifying more risk and protective factors that have the potential to be interventions to reduce the risk of cognitive loss in later life.

A key aim of the DASH study is to investigate why some ethnic groups experience higher rates of certain diseases than other ethnic groups in adulthood.

The cohort contains over 6,500 pupils recruited from 51 schools across 10 inner-London boroughs. Pupils were aged 11-13 years old at the start of the study in 2003, and were followed up at 2005/06, 2010-13 and 2012/13. DASH was designed to have a sizeable number of respondents from the major ethnic minority groups and  has had high response rates in conventionally thought ‘hard to reach’ populations. Cultural differences within South Asian groups are well known but very little is known about these issues among those of African origin. In DASH, Black Caribbeans, Nigerians, Ghanaians and other Africans can be identified separately so that differences in health and well-being can be explored. The cohort is now in their early 20s and around 81% of the baseline sample has been traced via postal, electronic and web-based strategies. 

Socio-demographic, area, family life, social support, health (illness and health behaviour) and psychosocial data were collected from children at baseline and follow-up via self-complete questionnaires.

The data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).

The data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:

Counts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;
There are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.
When looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.
Coding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW) is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.

Due to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team.

46,"Remote rural places have always experienced inequity in access to health care facilities and services. Even where places are equipped with facilities, the availability of trained health care providers is a challenge.

Recent advances in technology have enabled clinicians to deploy telemedicine in remote locations. Telehealthcare provides a holistic approach to health and wellbeing by improving access. However, multiple barriers still exist to implement telehealthcare and to scale-up the available technology.

Use of telehealthcare for the management of Chronic Respiratory Disorders (CRDs) in India is not yet proven, hence a feasibility study will help to explore barriers and facilitators to the successful implementation of teleconsultation. This could be done by documenting views, opinions and experiences of opinion leaders and by understanding the perception of the stakeholders, including providers and patients, towards doctor-to-doctor teleconsultation.

This study will generate evidence for creating a policy on ‘Management of overall chronic diseases at remote rural area in India using teleconsultation’.

We aim to repurpose and expand an existing pandemic reporting platform to determine the attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, the uptake and effectiveness of any new pandemic vaccine (once available) and any protective effect conferred by existing or new antimicrobial drugs and other therapies.

Methods and analysis: A prospective observational cohort will be used to monitor daily/weekly the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in approximately 5.4?million individuals registered in general practices across Scotland. A national linked dataset of patient-level primary care data, out-of-hours, hospitalisation, mortality and laboratory data will be assembled. The primary outcomes will measure association between: (A) laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity and mortality, and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics; and (B) healthcare burden of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics. The secondary outcomes will estimate: (A) the uptake (for vaccines only); (B) effectiveness; and (C) safety of new or existing therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between population characteristics and primary outcomes will be assessed via multivariate logistic regression models. The effectiveness of therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials will be assessed from time-dependent Cox models or Poisson regression models. Self-controlled study designs will be explored to estimate the risk of therapeutic and prophylactic-related adverse events.

The Leeds NIHR Biomarker Research Tissue Bank (RTB) is part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research award, focused on biomarker evaluation in selected disease areas.  The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.
The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  

Sample collections:
Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:
-	847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples 
-	514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine
-	706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)
-	149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine.
All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. 
Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

Furthermore, it is unclear how people with cancer-related strokes should be treated; including if standard treatments are still beneficial or whether a more tailored approach is required.  

This is a highly granular dataset of >16,000 patients with a confirmed cerebrovascular event including hospital presentation, serial physiology, every treatment prescribed and administered, and outcomes for the subsequent 12 months. It differentiates patients into those with a known or newly diagnosed malignancy and those without, and cancer types can be linked to pathology staining information, if needed.

93,"Background
The Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) Benchmark Audit (SAMBA) is a national benchmark audit of acute medical care. The aim of SAMBA19 is to describe the severity of illness of acute medical patients presenting to Acute Medicine within UK hospitals, speed of assessment, pathway and progress seven days after admission and to provide a comparison for each participating unit with the national average (or ‘benchmark’). On average >150 hospitals take part in this audit per year.
SAMBA19 summer audit measured adherence to some of the standards for acute medical care. Acute Medical Units work 24-hours per day and 365 days a year. They are the single largest point of entry for acute hospital admissions and most patients are at their sickest within the first 24-hours of admission. 
This dataset includes
•	Total number of patients assessed by acute medicine across ED, AMU and Ambulatory Care. 
•	Medical and nursing levels 
•	Severity of illness 
•	Timeliness in processes of care 
•	Clinical outcomes 7 days after admission

Illumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient’s doctor.

To help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data – to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.

ECDS Type 011 is better equipped to keep pace with the increasing complexity of delivering emergency care than its predecessor.  This means that the improved quality of data collected in emergency departments provides better support to healthcare planning and better-informed decision making on improvements to services. 

This improved data helps improve understanding of:
The complexity and acuity of attending patients
The causes of rising demand
The value added by emergency departments.

ECDS also allows:
The capture of better diagnostic data to ensure an enhanced understanding of need, activity and outcomes. 
Consistent monitoring of data across local and national initiatives
support for injury surveillance, such that it will be possible to identify patterns that may be amenable to targeted interventions and improved public health.
Which in turn informs more effective and efficient resource deployment.

The “high risk” list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be “at risk”. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:

• “At high risk” – a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO – should practice complete social “shielding” NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups.

119,"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization rapidly issued guidance on maintaining essential health services during the pandemic, highlighting prevention, maternity, emergency care and chronic diseases, without mention of palliative care. Palliative care is multidisciplinary, holistic and person-centered treatment, care and support for people with life-limiting illness, and those important to them, such as family and friends. In the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative care has an important role in ensuring symptom control, training of nonspecialists in symptom management and care of dying patients, compassionate communication, psychosocial support for patients, carers and health care professionals, advance care planning and bereavement support, supporting patients wherever they want to be cared for.

The CovPall (Rapid evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic response in palliative and end of life care: national delivery, workforce and symptom management) study aimed to understand the response of and challenges faced by palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify factors associated with challenges experienced, in particular shortages of equipment, medicines and staff. It is the first multinational survey on the response of and challenges to palliative care services during the pandemic. 

The study included a cross-sectional online survey of palliative care services and hospices, and a multicentre cohort study of COVID-19 patients seen and treated by palliative care services. It is made up of two work packages.

Work package 1 aimed to identify how palliative care and hospice services changed, how their staff, volunteers and others adapted their practices, and their challenges and innovations.

Work package 2 determined which symptoms and problems patients had, how they changed over time, and which treatments/therapies were used and seemed to work best.

This dataset covers WP1, the online survey of palliative care services, the first main component of CovPall. The survey opened on April 23rd, 2020 and closed on July 31st, 2020. 458 valid responses were collected: 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, 95 rest of the world, 1 missing country. Overall, 261 services provided inpatient palliative care units, 261 home care teams, 217 hospital palliative care teams, and 119 home nursing teams.

In July 2010 the A&E data mart was extended further to collect items such as diagnosis, several injury fields and an alcohol involved flag, which will be used to identify whether the patient’s alcohol consumption was a factor in the attendance. The collection of the new fields has been driven by a variety of SG policy decisions and interest from a number of organisations. Although there is now the facility to submit these additional fields, they are still under development and PHS are working with the NHS Boards to support data collection and quality. There are two types of data submitted to the A&E datamart: episode and aggregate level data. All hospitals with Emergency Departments submit episode level data containing a detailed record for each patient attendance.

The main post-operative complications are sepsis, sub-hepatic abscess, haemorrhage, bile leakage and retained bile duct stones, with sepsis the most common post-operative complications.

Sepsis post-surgery is costly to the individual, associated with a reduced quality of life, increased length of stay, pain, loss of function and mortality.  Although risk factors for developing sepsis are recognised, these cannot be applied at an individual level, making it difficult to predict who might develop sepsis, in order to implement mitigation strategies.

We also aim to understand the feasibility and acceptability of introducing and using locally made innovative low-cost bubble CPAP in these real-life settings in two selected district hospitals, prior to commencing our multicentre trial.

Hypoxaemia, a low level of oxygen in the blood, is one of the main risk factors for death due to pneumonia among children.

District hospitals in Bangladesh are considered as secondary level referral hospitals and usually provide care of paediatric patients in paediatric wards, including children with pneumonia and severe pneumonia.

District hospitals do not have additional respiratory support available to children who are failing to improve following treatment with low-flow oxygen supplementation, the World Health Organization standard. As a result, these children may die due to lack of availability of additional respiratory support.

Bubble CPAP (a low-cost, locally made device to deliver oxygen) improved survival rates when provided to treat severe pneumonia in tertiary hospitals. This study will explore whether the same technology made available in district hospitals could provide the same patient benefit.

160,"NHS Wales hospital admissions (Inpatients and daycases) dataset comprising of attendance and clinical information for all hospital admissions: includes diagnoses and operations performed. Includes spell and episode level data.

The data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).

The data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:

Counts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;
There are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.
When looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.
Coding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.

Due to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.","['https://imperialcollegehealthpartners.com/discover-now/north-west-london-covid-19-data-repository/', 'https://www.nwlondonccgs.nhs.uk/professionals/whole-systems-integrated-care-wsic-dashboards-and-information-sharing/information-de-identified-users']",NOT APPLICABLE

This has been included as one of the 34 knowledge gaps specified in the WHO R&D Blueprint WHO 2019 Novel Coronavirus Global research and innovation forum: towards a research roadmap published recently. One of the key approaches to containing COVID-19 has been self-quarantine and social distancing, which although is the need of the day but not easy to manage posing multiple challenges especially in a Pakistani community which follows strong cultural and social beliefs. It is, therefore important to identify the perception, practice and attitude of the community towards containing this disease.

Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of irreversible sight loss. Worldwide, an estimated 60 million people have glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition of increased intraocular pressure in the eye. Because it may be asymptomatic until a relatively late stage, diagnosis is frequently delayed. There are four general categories of glaucoma: primary open-angle and angle-closure, and secondary open and angle-closure glaucoma.

The UHB glaucoma dataset is a longitudinal dataset consisting of routinely collected clinical metadata from patients receiving treatment for glaucoma at UHB, from 2007 to the present. 

This dataset encompasses all patients at UHB who have received a diagnosis of primary or secondary glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Clinical metadata includes demographic information, visual acuities, central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure, optic nerve head findings, and mean deviation of the Humphrey visual fields.

This dataset is continuously updating, however, as of 1st October 2021, it consisted of 5065 people This is a large single centre database from patients with glaucoma and covers more than a decade of follow-up for these patients.

Early warning systems (EWS) are bedside tools used to assess basic physiological parameters to identify patients with potential or established critical illness. Evidence suggests that they may predict risk of intensive care admission, death and length of hospital stay.  In 2017, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) published an updated National Early Warning Score, referred to as NEWS2, based upon six physiological parameters. It is associated with specific clinical response recommendations in which a step change occurs at a threshold NEWS2 score ?5, requiring an urgent clinical response no matter what the presenting complaint or condition.

PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups. WM has a large number of elderly residents but is the youngest population in the UK.  Birmingham has the highest birth rate in England.  It also has the highest infant mortality rate. WM life expectancy is 1.8 years less than in London. There are particularly high rates of physical inactivity, obesity, smoking & diabetes.  Each day >100,000 people are treated in hospital, see their GP or are cared for by the NHS.

EHR. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.

197,"""The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalised with severe breathing difficulty is increasing. Unfortunately, there is acute scarcity in the availability of mechanical ventilators to meet the increasing demand of hospitalised COVID-19 patients requiring assisted breathing. The situation is particularly alarming in countries with limited resources like Bangladesh. Low- and middle-income countries urgently need low-cost adaptive technologies to provide CPAP. A trial by the lead investigator demonstrated that a locally made low-cost bubble CPAP was effective in significantly reducing the mortality in children with severe pneumonia. Bubble CPAP device comprises (a) an interface; nasal seal, (b) oxygen delivery piping, connectors and nasal cannula, (c) appropriately sized transparent plastic bottles (containing sterilized water). The safety of the pediatric device and its use in children with acute respiratory disease has already been approved by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA), Government of Bangladesh. Adapting this technology, if safe and scaled up, could potentially reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and subsequently averting deaths among adult COVID-19 patients. 

Our adaptations have included ensuring adequate seal for the interface (mask for nose) when delivering oxygen at high pressure to meet the demand of hypoxaemia in adult lungs. To prevent nasal air leak around the mask, we developed and successfully tested a prototype in healthy individuals which is silicon-based and ergonomically designed considering the variations in size and direction of adult nasal cavities as well as the comfort of patients. This adaptive version of nasal canula was made with the help of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

The design phase has demonstrated that (a) using a collaborative approach we can consistently produce adult silicone nasal seals, (b) we can deliver effective PEEP with a mean pressure that is overall within +/-12% of target pressure, with most loss only at the highest pressure setting (15cmH2O), (c) the device is well tolerated by participants with no in-study adverse events of note and no skin injury or undue discomfort in relation to the cannula or flow.  

The safety phase initiated on 1st November 2020 and ended on 30th April 2021. We have enrolled twelve patients (ten RT-PCR negatives for COVID-19 and rest of the two RT-PCR positives for COVID-19) in this trial. One participant withdrew from the study by voluntary approach. The rest of the patients were successfully discharged. None of them developed any adverse event(s). 

This study aims to evaluate the barriers and operational challenges related to the introduction of adult bubble CPAP oxygen therapy along with the acceptability and usability of introduction of adult bubble CPAP in tertiary level hospitals of Bangladesh

209,"Background. Following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the annual risk of recurrent acute coronary syndrome or death is approximately 6-9% despite contemporary treatments (percutaneous coronary intervention, dual antiplatelet therapy and standard secondary prevention, including statins, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors). 

In recent years, many new strategies have been shown to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with coronary artery disease and these are recommended in the 2019 ESC guideline for chronic coronary syndromes. 

Novel medications for diabetes (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists) and lipids (ezetimibe and PCSK-9 inhibitors) have demonstrated reductions in adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. 

With treatment regimens becoming increasingly complex, it can be unclear which drugs are being used for each patient.

224,"PIONEER:  The impact of ethnicity and multi-morbidity on COVID-related outcomes; a primary care supplemented hospitalised dataset
Dataset number 3.0

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in January 2020.  Currently, there have been more than 65million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide.  Some individuals experience severe manifestations of infection, including viral pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.  Evidence suggests that older patients, those from some ethnic minority groups and those with multiple long-term health conditions have worse outcomes.  This secondary care COVID dataset contains granular demographic and morbidity data, supplemented from primary care records, to add to the understanding of patient factors on disease outcomes. 

PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups. WM has a large number of elderly residents but is the youngest population in the UK.  Each day >100,000 people are treated in hospital, see their GP or are cared for by the NHS. The West Midlands was one of the hardest hit regions for COVID admissions in both wave 1 and 2.

EHR. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.  UHB has cared for >5000 COVID admissions to date.  

Scope: All COVID swab confirmed hospitalised patients to UHB from January – May 2020.  The dataset includes highly granular patient demographics & co-morbidities taken from ICD-10 & SNOMED-CT codes but also primary care records and clinic letters.  Serial, structured data pertaining to care process (timings, staff grades, specialty review, wards), presenting complaint, acuity, all physiology readings (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations), all blood results, microbiology, all prescribed & administered treatments (fluids, antibiotics, inotropes, vasopressors, organ support), all outcomes.

Respiratory symptoms are common but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition, leading to inappropriate treatment. A lack of diagnosis also means the true burden of the disease is not appreciated.

To improve treatment of these conditions, we first need to understand how primary care doctors (who provide the majority of healthcare for rural populations in India) diagnose and treat people with chest symptoms, what makes it difficult for them to provide good care and how they think care can be improved.

260,"The ever evolving role of ASHA demands an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the workload, incentives and understanding of the work profile from the perspectives of the health system, community and ASHA herself in order to guide successful future implementation as well as sustainability of the programme. This study had a broad interest in both the full range of tasks and the different situations in which ASHA work and the changing context in which their role is interpreted. This study therefore used a mixed-methods approach (MMA) to assess and explore ASHAs’ perspectives of their workload alongside that of local healthcare colleagues in both rural and village contexts.

Background: 
Globally, Community Health Workers (CHWs) are integral contributors to many health systems. In India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been deployed since 2005. Engaged in multiple health care activities, they are a key link between the health system and population. ASHAs are expected to participate in new health programmes, prompting interest in their current workload from the perspective of the health system, community and their family.   
  
Methods: 
This MMA design  was conducted in rural and tribal Primary Health Centers (PHCs), in Pune district, Western Maharashtra, India. All ASHAs affiliated with these PHCs were invited to participate in the quantitative study, those agreeing to contribute in-depth interviews (IDI) were enrolled in an additional qualitative study. Key informants’ interviews  were conducted with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Block Facilitators and Medical Officers of the same PHCs. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically.

Results: 
We recruited 67 ASHAs from the two PHCs.  ASHAs worked up to 20 hours/week in their village of residence, serving populations of  approximately 800-1200, embracing an increasing range of activities, despite a workload that contributed to feelings of being rushed and constant tiredness. They juggled household work, other paid  jobs and their ASHA activities. Practical problems with travel added to time involved, especially in tribal areas where transport is lacking. Their sense of benefiting the community and respect and recognition in village brought happiness and job satisfaction. They were willing to take on new tasks. ASHAs perceived themselves as voluntary community health workers rather than as ""health activists.""

Conclusions:
ASHAs were struggling to balance their significant ASHA workload, and domestic tasks. They were proud of their role as CHWs and willing to take on new activities. Strategies to recruit, train, enhance skills, incentivise, and retain ASHAs, need to be prioritised.

261,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in low resource settings are neglected and often poorly diagnosed, leading to missed opportunities for early initiation of treatment and poor patient pathways. For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all – or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Similarly, compliance with treatments offered is poorly understood. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context.

262,"Bariatric surgery produces substantial, long-term weight loss with reduced morbidity and mortality. Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.
The Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. 
Patients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.

278,"Fast breathing is the most common sign of childhood pneumonia. It is identified by observing the child’s chest and counting respiratory rate (RR). However, manual count of RR is challenging for the health workers often resulting in misdiagnosis of pneumonia. The availability of novel RR counters (e.g., ChARM, Masimo Rad-G, uPM60) can support health workers by detecting fast breathing automatically. However, the absence of an appropriate reference standard to evaluate the performance of these devices is a challenge. The commonly used reference standard is manual RR counts by a human expert which might be biased. If good quality videos could be captured and RR interpretation from these videos could be systematically conducted, it could be an ideal and non-biased reference standard. This study is designed to develop a video expert panel (VEP) as a reference standard to evaluate automated RR counters to identify pneumonia in children. The study will assess the performance of ChARM device in terms of accuracy of counting RR, duration to take the count and any potential influence of the device on RR counts. The study will record the child’s chest movements, and the recorded videos will be interpreted by the VEP. A mechanism to interpret RR from the recorded videos and maintain ongoing quality control will be established. This study will be carried out in Bangladesh in two phases. Eligible children will be 0-2 months old presenting with any illness and 2-59 months old presenting with suspected pneumonia (cough and/or breathing difficulty). In Phase-I, we will develop a process of videography of the child’s chest movements and interpretation of RR by a VEP. We will establish the process of capturing good quality videos, making a set of reference videos and will train and standardise the VEP members using those reference videos. We will record videos from a hospital in Dhaka. We will take videos of child’s chest movements both with and without using of ChARM. In Phase-II, we will conduct a cross-sectional study in rural Sylhet for evaluation of the performance of ChARM device. We will enrol children presenting at first level health facilities and a sub-district hospital. This study will provide evidence to establish the videography of child’s chest movements and its interpretation by a VEP as an appropriate and non-biased reference standard to evaluate the performance of novel RR counters.

290,"Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a global strategy, developed by WHO and UNICEF, for the management of common childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, in low-resource settings. IMCI guides a service provider to follow a step-by-step approach in history taking, clinical assessment, classification of the illness and treatment for a sick child. IMCI classifications depend on the clinical assessment skills of service providers and this subjectivity might lead to misclassification and inappropriate referral/treatment.

Hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) is one of the strongest predictors of mortality due to pneumonia in children. Pulse oximetry (PO) is a non-invasive method for monitoring a person's blood oxygen level. The integration of PO in existing IMCI services could improve the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment.

There are several health systems barriers and operational challenges associated with introducing a new technology, like PO, in developing country settings.

The aim of the project is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and operational challenges of introducing PO in IMCI services through routine providers at first-level primary care health facilities in Bangladesh.

The embedded PhD aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability and operational challenges of introducing PO in IMCI services at first-level primary care health facilities in Bangladesh, as well as evaluating its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

300,"It is estimated that 95% of the two million deaths due to pneumonia occur in developing countries. In Bangladesh alone, six million cases of pneumonia are diagnosed every year.  Unfortunately, diagnostic methods to date lack sensitivity or are difficult to fully standardized. The lack of a reliable diagnostic hampers the execution of evidence based interventions, impacting the monitoring of interventions, like vaccines.

The “gold standard” for defining pneumonia are chest X-rays. However, the interpretations are subjective, sometimes requiring multiple radiologists/clinicians to reach a conclusive diagnosis. As there are few well-trained radiologists/clinicians in resource-poor settings, having a tool to aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia would be invaluable in the impact monitoring of interventions.

The aim of the project is to construct a computational framework to automatically and systematically interpret paediatric chest X-rays to diagnose pneumonia.

305,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is the classical acute-phase protein produced by the liver at rates regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-6. Acute phase CRP production is non-specific but generally reflects the extent and severity of whatever infective, inflammatory, traumatic and neoplastic conditions have triggered it (Pepys, M. B. & Hirschfield, G. M. J. Clin. Invest. 111, 1805-1812 (2003). CRP binds specifically to dead or dying cells and then activates complement, leading to enhanced inflammation and exacerbation of pre-existing tissue damage (Griselli, M. et al. J. Exp. Med. 190, 1733-1739 (1999). Large amounts of CRP in the blood can also increase damage to tissues that are already injured.  CRP may thus contribute to disease severity and death in COVID-19.   

Circulating CRP values in COVID-19 patients are closely associated with disease activity, severity and outcome (for example: L. Yan et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-0180-7). However, the published studies are of moderate size with only one or few CRP measurements per patient.

325,"Frailty is a syndrome of increased vulnerability to incomplete resolution of homeostasis (healing or return to baseline function) following a stressor event (such as an infection or fall) and it is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and reduced quality of life. Prevalence increases with age, but it should not be considered an inevitable consequence of ageing.

The pathophysiology of frailty is poorly understood but the immune and endocrine systems appear to be involved in its development or response. Age and frailty have been proven to be independently predictive of outcomes in patients admitted with an acute illness. 

In COVID-19, routine frailty identification has been used to inform decision making about high level of treatment. This is because frailty usually moderates the effect of age on mortality. Anecdotally, this effect has not been recognised by clinicians looking after older COVID-19 patients. Four papers have been published so far on the effect of frailty on COVID-19 with differing results.  However, all papers show the independent predictive value of age when controlling for frailty, which is not usually seen in studies of age and frailty in other acute illnesses.

327,"Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver. 
This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the SUS data set.
SUS data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:
1. private patients treated in NHS hospitals
2. patients resident outside of England
3. care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS

Each SUS record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:
1. clinical information about diagnoses and operations
2. patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
3. administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
4. geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live

NHS Digital apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published SUS data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

Who SUS is for
SUS provides data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including:

The Secondary Users Service (SUS) database is made up of many data items relating to A&E care
delivered by NHS hospitals in England. Many of these items form part of the national Commissioning Data Set (CDS), and are generated by the patient administration systems within each hospital.
1. national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC
2. local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)
3. provider organisations
4. government departments
5. researchers and commercial healthcare bodies
6. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
7. patients, service users and carers
8. the media

Uses of the statistics
The statistics are known to be used for:
1. national policy making
2. benchmarking performance against other hospital providers or CCGs  
3. academic research
4. analysing service usage and planning change
5. providing advice to ministers and answering a wide range of parliamentary questions
6. national and local press articles

343,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in low resource settings are neglected and often poorly diagnosed, leading to missed opportunities for early initiation of treatment and poor patient pathways. For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all – or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it’s vital we develop this understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke.

The PhD study aims to gather evidence through systematic review of literature about TPB based health interventions and conduct qualitative studies to inform the which constructs of TPB are important in developing an educational intervention which can effectively change the knowledge, attitude and health behaviour of people with CRD in these low resource settings.

National primary care sentinel network:
The RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.
Observational research
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.
Interventional research – ambition to be a hub for trials 
The RCGP RSC has produced a ‘Weekly Return’ of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients’ data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.
The RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.
We regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. 

Clinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.

363,"Synthetic Dataset: Patients at risk of sudden death: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Background
Well-created synthetic data establishes a governance risk-free environment for health care algorithm development and experimentation. This includes the evaluation of new treatment models, care management systems, clinical decision support, and more. Synthetic data is of particular use in rare diseases, where real data may be in short supply, or to replicate disease in less common patient demographics (such as certain ethnicities or co-morbid combinations).

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a rare genetic condition characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle, usually of the interventricular septum. Many affected individuals have no symptoms. Other people may experience chest pain; breathlessness and fainting. Arrhythmias can be life threatening and HCM is associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Some affected individuals develop potentially fatal heart failure, which may require heart transplantation.  Approximately 130,000 people have HCM in the UK, but there is a significant burden of undiagnosed disease and diagnostic delay.  Inheritance is autosomal dominant, with the most commonly involved genes being MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TNNI3. 

PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups and rare diseases including HCM, with a  regional specialist HCM service.

EHR. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds.  UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.  

Scope: This synthetic dataset reflects the diversity of the WM and the granularity of the HCM service.  It replicates longitudinal data including the care journey prior to diagnosis.  It includes ECHO provocation, CPEX, ECG including evidence of pre-excitation, as well as symptoms, family history, genetic testing and HCM phenotype. Outcomes and procedures are included.

Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality, accounting for 16% of under-five deaths globally – with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

For the management of common childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, in low-resource settings, adoption of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is globally recommended. IMCI classifications depend on the clinical assessment skills of service providers and this subjectivity might lead to misclassification and inappropriate referral/treatment.

Hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) is one of the strongest predictors of pneumonia mortality. Hypoxemia can be measured simply and effectively using pulse oximetry (PO).

The latest IMCI guidelines, from the World Health Organization (WHO), include the use of PO to classify severity of pneumonia in children and manage accordingly. Current IMCI practices in Pune district do not include PO in the treatment algorithms.

376,"The Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) was set up in 2004 and consented the first patient in 2005. The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.
A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.
Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.
The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality.

396,"Background: Hospital-Acquired pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator-Associated pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that is contracted by a patient 2 or more days after an admission.  HAP is often more serious than other lung infections due to the nature of the bacteria present in hospital settings, as they are more resistant to treatment than those in the community. HAP typically affects older patients with co-morbidities, those with weakened immune systems or a long-term chronic lung disease.  Ventilator-Associated pneumonia is the most common infection associated with a stay in intensive care, with increased long-term mortality and length of stays.  These data allow the investigation of the sensitivities of the bacteria, which antibiotics were administered and patient outcomes.  The period of data available allows for studying pre- and post- COVID-19 and the impact of ventilation.

Lung function is an important indicator of respiratory health and mortality. Measures of lung function show irreversible airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition affecting 900,000 people in the UK. Smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD but not all smokers are equally susceptible. Genetic approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of good lungs aim to reveal previously unknown molecular targets for drug development and to facilitate stratified approaches to treatment and care. This project aims to detect rare genetic variants associated with lung function. Once discovered, such variants tend to exert a large effect on disease risk and provide a means to translate findings from genetic studies of lung function to clinical relevant research and development.

private patients treated in NHS hospitals
patients resident outside of England

411,"Background:
The Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.
The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  

Current situation:
The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  

Sample processing and clinical data:
Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.
Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

422,"Background: Well-created synthetic data establishes a governance risk-free environment for health care algorithm development and experimentation. This includes the evaluation of new treatment models, care management systems, clinical decision support, and more. Synthetic data is of particular use in rare diseases, where real data may be in short supply, or to replicate disease in less common patient demographics (such as certain ethnicities or co-morbid combinations).

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a rare genetic condition characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle, usually of the interventricular septum. Many affected individuals have no symptoms. Other people may experience chest pain; breathlessness and fainting. Arrhythmias can be life threatening and HCM is associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Some affected individuals develop potentially fatal heart failure, which may require heart transplantation. Approximately 130,000 people have HCM in the UK, but there is a significant burden of undiagnosed disease and diagnostic delay.  Inheritance is autosomal dominant, with the most commonly involved genes being MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TNNI3. 

PIONEER geography: The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million and includes a diverse ethnic and socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups and rare diseases including HCM, with a regional specialist HCM service.

Electronic Health Records (EHR): University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services and specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds and 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary and secondary care record (Your Care Connected) and a patient portal “My Health”.  

Scope: This synthetic dataset reflects the diversity of the WM and the granularity of the HCM service. It replicates longitudinal data including the care journey prior to diagnosis.  It includes ECHO provocation, CPEX, ECG including evidence of pre-excitation, as well as symptoms, family history, genetic testing and HCM phenotype. Outcomes and procedures are included.   

Available supplementary data: Synthetic Ambulance data. Real HCM patient data, including from secondary and ambulance settings – forming a synthetic algorithm “build” and real “test” datasets.

432,"<p>This study aimed to recruit asthmatic children and to assess whether it was feasible to reduce their air pollution exposure levels by intervening with advice to decrease exposure. The following steps had been taken to assess the aim: First, this study assessed the participants’ BC exposure data collected before and after the intervention. In particular, the assessments explored how children would react within a week and 5 weeks after receiving the intervention. Second, the study explored when and where the exposure reduction occurred. This was done by dividing each BC data into a set of four predetermined microenvironments, i.e. home, commute, school and other microenvironments. The purpose of the four microenvironments was to simplify and consolidate participants’ actions during each monitoring period, which would identify which microenvironment had achieved the most significant effects because of the intervention. Finally, the study assessed the participants’ time weighted exposure levels. This was done by calculating the participants’ exposure levels for each microenvironment weighted with the time spent in them. In addition to the main objective, the study has also explored other variables, included participants’ paediatric asthma quality of life, asthma control tests and their lung function, as well as their NO2 exposure levels before and after the intervention. Overall, there was a significant (p<0.05) reduction in participants’ BC exposure after the intervention. Questionnaires revealed the participants’ asthma control had significantly improved after the intervention and the analysis of their cotinine and urinary particle loading levels were also declined after the intervention. As such, the findings from this study confirm the main research aim, which argued that reduced exposure to air pollution in asthmatic children is achievable via increased awareness of the health impacts that air pollution can have on them and that mitigating personal exposure is achievable via simple behavioural changes. </p>",['https://www.cprd.com/linked-data'],NJR

447,"Risk and outcomes of coagulopathies & arterial/venous thrombosis in acutely unwell patients
Dataset number 12.0

Coagulopathies and bleeding disorders can reflect hereditary conditions such as Haemophilia or von Willebrand disease, be associated with other diseases such as liver conditions, sepsis, trauma or be iatrogenic, related to therapies or their side effects.   Hospital associated venous thromboembolic (VTE) events remain common despite well known risk factors and effective prophylactic treatments. There are a number of blood biomarkers associated with coagulopathies, as well as genetic tests and treatments.  This dataset focuses on the acute presentation of coagulopathies, including in people with known bleeding/clotting disorders and in people for present with a new clotting or bleeding events during an acute presentation.

449,"For researchers   
Blood collection
We collect blood from donors aged between 18-60, who have been screened to ensure that it is safe for them to donate, that they are in good health, and not taking medications that might interfere with experiments.
Donors will have given consent for their samples to be used in a wide range of biomedical research applications, including genetic research and that undertaken by commercial organisations.
We are also able to collect samples from specific donors, for example within a certain age range, ethnicity or with a specific blood group. We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required.
Processing
We use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include:
Whole blood
 From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need.
Buffy coat
 We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.
Plasma
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.
Serum
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.
PBMCs
 We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.
Custom services
 We can develop specific processes to suit your exact requirements, so please get in contact if there is something specific you need for your research",,Not Applicable

460,"Background 

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospital admission, and in older adults has high rates of mortality and complications. CAP is associated with increased long-term mortality and loss of independence for older adults. CAP typically affects older adults with co-morbidities.  Complications such as sepsis, and empyema (infected fluid around the lung) prolong hospital admission, result in additional interventions in hospital and have higher mortality than CAP alone. The causative agents for CAP are often poorly identified in real world clinical practice.  

The treatment of patients with CAP is complex. Key decisions relate to the antibiotics used, the way antibiotics are given (in a tablet or by a drip) and the place of care (home, hospital and in hospital, a normal ward or intensive care).  These data will allow analyses on differing antimicrobial treatments and outcomes, as well as differing pathways of care.  This data has been constructed to support machine learning including algorithm generation and testing models.

Dataset 13.0

Background.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung condition characterised by progressive lung function limitation.   COPD is an umbrella term and encompasses a spectrum of pathophysiologies including chronic bronchitis, small airways disease and emphysema.  COPD caused an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide in 2016, and is estimated to be the third leading cause of death worldwide.  People with COPD experience flares in their symptoms, termed exacerbations.  Exacerbations are associated with increased mortality, morbidity, a faster decline in lung function and other systemic illness such as heart attacks and strokes.  Despite this impact, COPD exacerbations are poorly characterised and have been without novel treatments for >30 years.

PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups. The West Midlands has a high prevalence of COPD, reflecting the high rates of smoking and industrial exposure.

500,"The burden to the patient with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high, both in terms of health-related quality of life and health status. Exacerbations are associated with significant mortality, lead to frequent hospitalisation, and are a major determinant of COPD costs. Due to the natural history of COPD and its relentlessly progressive nature it needs long-term care, which means the range of medical and/or social services designed to help people with disabilities or chronic care needs. Hence designing the method to measure direct medical cost, direct non-medical cost, indirect cost and loss of productivity collectively, with reference to COPD, would be value-added information.

In this study, family, health system and societal perspective will be adopted which will be useful for informing policy decisions to local stakeholders and this data will be used to generate evidence to write further large studies. Interviews would be conducted for key stakeholders in the community to understand the burden of COPD to the society.

Primary hip replacement has its own specific dataset for procedures.
Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of bespoke data collection to support the NJR . This is submitted to NEC Software Solutions (contracted to the NJR) for processing and is used to monitor the quality and safety of patient care and outcomes. 
This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the NJR research ready data set.
NJR data covers all procedures carried out in NHS and independent sector hospitals  in England, Wales (from 2003), Northern Ireland )from 2013), the Isle of Man (from 2015) and the States of Guernsey (from 2019).
Each NJR record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient treated at an NHS or independent sector hospital, including:
• clinical information about surgical indications and operations
• patient information, such as age group and gender
• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used
• outcomes, such as whether a revision procedure has been undertaken
NJR apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published NJR data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.
Who NJR data is for
NJR can provide data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including:
• national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC
• local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)
• provider organisations
• government departments
• researchers and commercial healthcare bodies
• National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
• patients, service users and carers
• the media
Uses of the statistics
The statistics are known to be used for:
• national policy making
• benchmarking performance against other hospital providers or CCGs  
• academic research
• analysing service usage and planning change
• providing advice to ministers and answering a wide range of parliamentary questions
• national and local press articles

502,"Prebiotics are compounds in food that benefit health via affecting the gut microbiome. Omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with differences in gut microbiome composition and are widely accepted to have health benefits, although recent large trials have been inconclusive. We carried out a 6-week dietary intervention comparing the effects of daily supplementation with 500 mg of omega-3 versus 20 g of a well-characterized prebiotic, inulin. Inulin supplementation resulted in large increases in Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. In contrast, omega-3 supplementation resulted in significant increases in Coprococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp, and significant decreases in the fatty-liver associated Collinsella spp. On the other hand, similar to the results with inulin supplementation which resulted in significant increases in butyrate, iso-valerate, and iso-butyrate (p < .004), omega-3 supplementation resulted in significant increases in iso-butyrate and isovalerate (p < .002) and nearly significant increases in butyrate (p < .053). Coprococcus, which was significantly increased post-supplementation with omega-3, was found to be positively associated with iso-butyric acid (Beta (SE) = 0.69 (0.02), P = 1.4 x 10-3) and negatively associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL (Beta (SE) = -0.381 (0.01), P = .001) and VLDL-TG (Beta (SE) = -0.372 (0.04), P = .001) after adjusting for confounders.

503,"A regional asset for Yorkshire and Humber Data, a population-based database of all children and young people (0–29 years) diagnosed with cancer residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region in England (10,000 tumour registrations in children aged 0-14 years since 1974 and Adolescents and Young Adults aged 15-29 years since 1990). The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer
outcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children’s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref—CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. 

The Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.
The core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:
•	Maintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.
•	Investigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.
•	Undertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.
•	Describe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.

Example of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:

1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality
(Smith et al, 2019)

Respiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.

2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics
(Smith et al, 2018)

Statistical “cure models” provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.

3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data
(Smith et al, 2017)

In this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 – using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 – using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 – using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.

519,"Chronic respiratory diseases remain one of the leading causes of death from non-communicable disease, with the majority of deaths due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD presents a significant healthcare burden and is detrimental to quality of life. Currently, there are no disease modifying treatments.

Further to the burden of stable COPD, patients experience acute exacerbations (AECOPD), defined as an acute worsening of symptoms which requires a change in treatment.  These are important events, associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term health impacts. Patients who exacerbate frequently are more likely to have a faster decline in lung function, have a lower quality of life and experience adverse cardiovascular events.  Whilst there are therapies to reduce exacerbation frequency and treat the acute event, options have limited efficacy and have not changed in overall drug class for many years.

Exacerbations are defined by the severity of the symptoms and the treatments involved – so a severe exacerbation is one which requires hospitalisation.  However, in our ageing and increasingly frail population, hospitalisation can be required for even a minor event, if a person is already struggling to cope at home.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare, autoimmune cholestatic liver disease that puts patients at risk of life-threatening complications. PBC is primarily a disease of women, affecting approximately one in 1,000 women over the age of 40. 

With an estimated total prevalence in the UK of ~3.9 per 10,000 of the population, equating to around 19,175 people in England, the survival of PBC patients is significantly worse than the general population if left untreated. 

Many patients are diagnosed after multiple acute care admissions, with tummy pain, jaundice or scarring of the liver.  The diagnosis can still be missed here, putting patients at increased risk of liver complications and even death. 

This dataset focuses on describing the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of PBC patients.

The Welsh Health Survey (WHS) collects information on the health and health-related lifestyles of people living in Wales. It is a major source of information about the health of people in Wales, the way the NHS is used, and behaviours that can affect health, such as smoking and alcohol consumption.

Data for the WHS is collected via face-to-face-interviews and self-completion questionnaires. The sampling unit for the WHS are households, however all adults within households were asked to take part. Families with children under the age of 16 are eligible, however where the household has 3 or more children, up to two children between the ages of 0 and 15 are randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Interviews are used to collect data at the household level, with questionnaires distributed to household members. Information on the household type and employment status of the household reference person are collected, and the interviewer is asked to comment on the condition of the property. Separate self-completion questionnaires are used to collect data for adults and young people (aged 13-15), whilst adults/guardians are required to complete questionnaires on behalf of children younger than 13 years old.

The WHS data, as provided via the UK Data Archive, is split into two separate datasets, these relating to adults – 16 and older – and children.

541,"Lactate is a chemical produced by the body as cells consume energy - in times of stress more lactate is produced. In the past, we thought that lactate was just a waste product, but more recently we have learned that lactate has an important role to play in the body. 

People suffering from certain severe illnesses may have a high ‘lactate’ level in their blood. This is particularly common in the following: 

Severe infections which the body cannot properly control (sepsis) 

People who have sustained severe injuries (traumatic injury) 

People who are critically unwell with other illnesses (needing treatment in an intensive care unit) 

Some patients will develop a high lactate level when they are in hospital. Doctors recognise that this indicates the patient is becoming more unwell, but it is often challenging to know exactly what is causing the lactate level to be raised. 

Raised lactate level has been associated with worse outcome in other syndromes, including major trauma and undifferentiated critical illness; however healthy individuals may generate very high lactate levels during strenuous exercise from which they recover without any harm. It is unclear whether lactate in itself is harmful to patients. This dataset provides unique insight into the potential role of lactate as not only a biomarker but a therapeutic target in acute illness.

• clinical information about surgical indications and operations
• patient information, such as age group and gender
• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used
• outcomes, such as whether a revision procedure has been undertaken
NJR apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published NJR data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.

The data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a ‘legitimate patient relationship’ with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. 

The dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. 

The dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, “Digest2” and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, “TPP_Linked” (0 or 1). Additional fields per table are defined in Table 1. No fields contain sensitive information.

553,"In low and middle income countries (LMICs) like India, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is sporadically available either at a tertiary care centres or in teaching hospitals located in urban settings. There are several barriers that exist in implementation (labor intensive, time consuming, lack of trained health care professionals, high drop-out rate and cost of rehabilitation) as well as accessing (lack of awareness among CRD patients on PR, unavailability of a PR program and unwilling to spend money on PR) a PR program which hampers the uptake of PR in such settings. Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, India, a partner site of RESPIRE research conducted a feasibility intervention trial on chronic respiratory disease (CRD) ""Prevention, detection and treatment of adult lung disease including lung cancer in a poor, rural population in Tamil Nadu: feasibility study in rural south India"". About 1 year through the study, some have reported remarkable improvement to standard treatment and a significant number have shown suboptimal response to standard treatment. With a need to revamp our CRD patients' health and also to develop a low cost feasible model to endorse and encourage PR in resource-poor settings, the follow-up study was undertaken with the objective to test the feasibility of a peer-led community based comprehensive PR assisted by professionals in a rural Indian setting. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to test the feasibility of the study. The quantitative data collected were demographic details, medical history, smoking history, occupation history, hemoglobin level, BMI and treatment details. The baseline and endline assessment included physical activity assessment using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, activities of daily living using London Chest Activity of Daily Living scale. The nutritional status was assessed using 24 hour recall for a week day and weekend by the Nutritionist. Anxiety and depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Exercise capacity using a six-minute walk test (6-MWT), upper limb strength was assessed using the hand held dynamometer and lower limb endurance was assessed using cycle ergometer. After 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation program, endline assessment was done. The qualitative data was collected at the begining and end of the PR training program. Indepth interviews were conducted among patients and peer volunteers. Data collected was transcribed and translated into English.

At the end of 8 weeks PR program, thirty patients with chronic respiratory disease should see a significant improvement in exercise capacity (mean difference in 6-minute walk test, 56.35 m; P <0.01), endurance (mean difference in cycling time, 71.4 s; P <0.01), and upper limb strength (mean difference in Hand dynamometer, 5.1 Kg; P <0.01).

This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the SUS data set.
SUS data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:
1. private patients treated in NHS hospitals
2. patients resident outside of England
3. care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS

Each SUS record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:
1. clinical information about diagnoses and operations
2. patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
3. administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge

We have two main collections: the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) and the Royal Devon and Exeter Tissue Bank (RDETB). 
The PRB has ethics to accept gifted samples from completed studies, and the bulk of the collection is from a dedicated biobank collection called EXTEND (the EXeter TEN thousanD), which aims to recruit one in ten of the local Exeter population. The majority (c. 75%) of our studies are local CI led, and we specialise mainly in diabetes, obesity and related pathologies. However, the majority of people within the EXTEND study are fit and well.
The RDETB has overarching ethics to collect samples from diagnostic procedures with patients' consent. Each collection within the RDETB uses a standardised consent and collection approach to obtain material that would otherwise be destroyed or not retained. There is scope for prospective studies recruiting through the RDETB.
Both collections have a steering committee controlling access, including lay members from within the biobank. There is a standardised approach for requests and the committee sits once a month. In addition, access to gifted samples within the PRB will involve contact with the PI, where possible. Some studies have additional steering committees where they have been carried out in consortia with other centres.

598,"This project aims to map and analyse global and national governance of childhood pneumonia (CP) control through examination of existing health policies, financing mechanisms and health system analysis. Lois will investigate the extent of neglect at the international level and look at the extent of neglect at the domestic level, uncovering if and why there are differences when comparing global to national prioritisation, what the local effects of this are and how Bangladesh’s policies have adapted to tackle CP.

Globally, childhood pneumonia (CP) remains the leading infectious cause of death among children under five. However, the disease receives less prioritisation and funding in global health when compared to other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and polio. Thus, CP can be described as a neglected health issue at the global level due to lack of synergy among key stakeholders and current agenda-setting practices between influential global health actors.

Bangladesh is typically seen as a success story due to huge reductions in CP in the last few decades. Nevertheless, it remains the 13th highest burden country globally for CP. As such, Bangladesh offers a unique example of what governments are doing to address CP, despite the lack of global prioritisation. Due to the complex wider determinants of health that need to be considered when tackling CP, this disease is a useful litmus test of how well a health system is functioning.

This project aims to map and analyse global and national governance of CP control through examination of existing health policies, financing mechanisms and health system analysis. Lois will investigate the extent of neglect at the international level and look at the extent of neglect at the domestic level, uncovering if and why there are differences when comparing global to national prioritisation, what the local effects of this are and how Bangladesh’s policies have adapted to tackle CP.

The SMS1932 took place simultaneously across schools in Scotland on the 1st of June, 1932, and used the Moray House Test (No. 12; MHT) of general intelligence. Almost every child attending school and born in 1921 (N = 87,498) was tested. The same MHT was administered to almost every child born in 1936 and attending school on the 4th of June, 1947 for the SMS1947 (N = 70,805). Decades later, participants of both Surveys, mostly living in Edinburgh and the surrounding area (the Lothians) in older age, were invited to participate in the Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC) studies. Between 1999 and 2001, 550 of the SMS1932 were recruited to Wave 1 of the LBC1921 study, at a mean age of 79 years. Between 2004 and 2007, 1,091 members of SMS1947 were recruited to Wave 1 of the LBC1936 study, at a mean age of 70 years. Both cohorts re-sat the MHT at initial follow-up. In addition, a large amount of other cognitive, psychosocial, lifestyle, medical, biomarker, genetic, brain imaging and other data were collected. 

The LBC studies set out principally to examine the nature and determinants of non-pathological cognitive ageing from childhood to older age, and within in older age. However, in recent years the scope of the studies has extended to identifying more risk and protective factors that have the potential to be interventions to reduce the risk of cognitive loss in later life.

Predictive values generated based on healthy population are used in interpretation of spirometry data. Currently, in India, most of the predicted values used in the spirometry data interpretation are based on predictive values from western populations. As no predictive values are available for the Indian population, physicians and researchers from India depend on the western countries guidelines such as ERS, ECHRS for the predictive values.

Evidence shows that COVID-19 infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest x-rays with a pattern that is difficult to characterise using only the human eye. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning, which can consistently identify infected patients from non-infected ones given a radiographic examination of the patient, can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool. Considering chest x-rays are one of the most commonly performed radiological studies (coupled with the near universal availability of testing machines), applying AI techniques on them could prove to be valuable for COVID-19 diagnosis during clinical management. We therefore aim to establish a reliable diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients who present with COVID-19 related abnormalities on chest x-rays. Over the course of 7 months we will build a dataset using open source data which are freely available, as well as with de-identified patient data collected from health institutions in Pakistan. Using this dataset, a deep learning model will be trained, which would be able to accurately screen patients who present with abnormalities relevant to COVID-19 in their radiographic examination. This tool will ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of COVID-19 patients, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

The initial birth survey captured information on 17,415 babies born in a single week – or 98 per cent of total births across England, Scotland and Wales. Since then, the cohort has been followed up ten times at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 44, 46, 50, and most recently at age 55, when 9,137 cohort members took part. At 7, 11 and 16, the sample was augmented with those who had been born overseas in the relevant week and subsequently moved to Great Britain. This resulted in a total sample of 18,558 cohort members, who have been followed ever since. The tenth sweep of the NCDS originally behan in January 2020, when the cohort members were age 62, with data becoming available for researchers to use from early 2024. 

Over the course of cohort members’ lives, information has been collected on their physical and educational development, economic circumstances, employment, family life, health behaviour, wellbeing, social participation and attitudes. The main data collection methods used during the study have included questionnaires, cognitive assessments, clinical assessments and nurse measurements. Questionnaires have been used to gather a variety of information about study members, including social and family background, mental health and wellbeing, income and housing, and marriage and employment status. Cognitive assessments have measured verbal and language ability in childhood, as well as literacy and numeracy from adolescence into later life.

637,"Background: A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection that affects the bladder (cystitis), urethra (urethritis) or kidneys (pyelonephritis). They are more prevalent in women, and the incidence in women over 65 years old is double the rate compared with the overall female population. Catheterisation is known to affect the likelihood of infection. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence suggests that UTIs in the elderly are often over-diagnosed and over-treated. This has led to NHS England requiring a reduction in the number of Trimethoprim prescriptions prescribed to patients over 70 years old.

647,"Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) is a database containing details of all admissions, A and E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England.

Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver.

This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the HES data set.

HES data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:

- private patients treated in NHS hospitals
- patients resident outside of England
- care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS

Each HES record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:

- clinical information about diagnoses and operations
- patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
- administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
- geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live

We apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published HES data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

The Core NDA collects information for a 15-month audit period. This is collected from both primary and secondary care services – for example:
• 2019-20 audit collects for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 March 2020
• 2020-21 audit collects for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2021
Annual data is typically released in November. 
Quarterly data collection
The data is extracted quarterly from general practices via the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES). 
Indicative timings for extraction are:
• August 2019: collection of data from January to June 2019
• November 2019: collection of data from January to September 2019
• February 2020: collection of data from January to December 2019
• May 2020: collection of full audit year data 
The first 3 quarters of data are typically published the month after extraction.
The NDA started in 2003-4 as part of the Diabetes National Service Framework (NSF) implementation plan to provide reliable measurements for service improvement and monitor the impact of the NSF. The core components of the NDA were designed to align with the Diabetes NSF, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and Quality Standards in respect of achievement rates for annual care process, and treatment targets and disease measure including premature mortality.  It integrates data reflecting contributions from all primary and secondary care providers and captures data on over 3 million people with diabetes each year. 

Since 2010 new elements have been incorporated into the audit programme to include specialised care pathways. The NDA programme now reports on:

• Care processes and Treatment Targets (NDA Core)
• Complications and Mortality (NDA Core) 
• Pregnancy in women with diabetes (NPID)
• Foot ulcer management in people with diabetes (NDFA)
• Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in people with Type 1 Diabetes 
• Care of in-patients with diabetes (NaDIA) 
• Complications related to the four main harms that can occur to inpatients with diabetes in Acute hospitals in England (NaDIA – Harms)
• Transitional care for people with diabetes through childhood to adulthood
• Progress on invitation to attend and uptake of offer in the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme 

The inclusion of NDA in the GP Contract allowed collection of data directly from primary care systems via the GPES for NDA Core primary care data. This has resulted in increased participation and reduction in burden on primary care providers due to the automated nature of GPES. Participation from both primary care and secondary care has increased year on year, now at its highest level since NDA commenced in 2003.

662,"<p>Background: Despite well-described sex differences in asthma incidence, there remains uncertainty about the role of female sex hormones in the development of asthma. Objective: We sought to investigate whether hormonal contraceptive use, its subtypes, and duration of use were associated with new-onset asthma in reproductive-age women. Methods: Using the Optimum Patient Care Research Database, a UK national primary care database, we constructed an open cohort of 16- to 45-year-old women (N = 564,896) followed for up to 17 years (ie, January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016). We fitted multilevel Cox regression models to analyze the data. Results: At baseline, 26% of women were using any hormonal contraceptives. During follow-up (3,597,146 person-years), 25,288 women developed asthma, an incidence rate of 7.0 (95% CI, 6.9-7.1) per 1000 person-years. Compared with nonuse, previous use of any hormonal contraceptives (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68-0.72), combined (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68-0.72), and progestogen-only therapy (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67-0.74) was associated with reduced risk of new-onset asthma. For current use, the estimates were as follows: any (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.61-0.65), combined (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.67), and progestogen-only therapy (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.56-0.62). Longer duration of use (1-2 years: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86; 3-4 years: HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.67; 5+ years: HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.49) was associated with a lower risk of asthma onset than nonuse. Conclusions: Hormonal contraceptive use was associated with reduced risk of new-onset asthma in women of reproductive age. Mechanistic investigations to uncover the biological processes for these observations are required. Clinical trials investigating the safety and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives for primary prevention of asthma will be helpful to confirm these results. </p>

672,"The Secondary Uses Service (SUS +) is a collection of healthcare data required by hospitals and used for planning health care, supporting payments, commissioning policy development and research.

The Secondary Uses Services Payment By Results data set is derived from SUS+ and includes key data in support of the national tariff system which is used to determine the reimbursement of NHS funded care in England.

Following the handover of responsibility for the NHS Payment system from DH to NHS England and NHS improvements (formerly Monitor) in April 2013, PbR was effectively replaced by the National Tariff Payment System (NTPS) in April 2014. This new payment system currently retains the vast majority of PbR policy. Due to the embedded terminology, data item and extract naming consistency, SUS continues to refer PbR in SUS and therefore the terms 'Payment by Results', 'PbR', 'National Tariff Payment System' and 'NTPS' should be considered interchangeable when using SUS or any SUS Guidance. 

Payment by Results (PbR) provides a transparent, rules-based national tariff system, used to determine the reimbursement of NHS funded care in England. PbR rewards efficiency, supports patient choice and diversity and encourages activity for sustainable waiting time reductions. Payment is linked to activity and adjusted for casemix. This ensures a fair and consistent basis for hospital funding rather than being reliant principally on historic budgets and the negotiating skills of individual managers. PbR is the payment system in England under which commissioners pay providers of NHS-funded healthcare for each patient seen or treated, considering the complexity of the patient’s healthcare needs. The two fundamental features of PbR are nationally determined currencies and tariffs. Currencies are the unit of healthcare for which a payment is made and can take a number of forms covering different time periods from an outpatient attendance or a stay in hospital, to a year SUS+ PbR Reference Manual v4.64 Copyright © 2019 NHS Digital 5 of care for a long-term condition. Tariffs are the set prices paid for each currency.

PbR currently covers most of the acute healthcare in hospitals, with national tariffs for admitted patient care, outpatient attendances and accident and emergency. This activity is submitted using Commissioning Data Sets (CDS). Current policy intends that the scope of PbR and national tariff will expand in future by introducing currencies and tariffs for mental health, community and other services

The initial stimulus was to obtain robust prospective information on the risk of breast cancer associated with use of different types of menopausal hormone therapy (HT). When planning the necessary large-scale prospective study, an equally important aim was to obtain reliable information on the effects of other potentially modifiable factors that affect women’s health as they age.

The study includes 1 in 4 of all UK women born between 1935 and 1950, recruited through NHS breast screening centres in England and Scotland in 1996-2001. The 66 NHS breast screening centres that recruited participants covered about half of the UK population. 

While the initial stimulus was to study the risk of breast cancer and other conditions associated with the use of menopausal hormones, most of the women who joined the study had reached adulthood in the 1960s and had considerably different lifestyles to those of previous generations. For example, large proportions had begun smoking and using oral contraceptives as teenagers and young adults. The prevalence of obesity was also increasing and there were claims that other behaviours, such as diet, had important effects on health. To answer questions about the effects of these factors on health reliably requires large scale population-based evidence. The Million Women Study is therefore investigating the short-term and long-term effects of these and many other factors on women’s risk of developing or dying from different types of cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and other mental and neurodegenerative disorders, and many other conditions in middle and in old age.",,Not Applicable

The purpose of this dataset collected is to assess the burden of CRD and its social and economic impact on the community and health system.

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD) especially asthma & Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are common public health problems with high prevalence and mortality rates across the world. Although the majority of deaths and disability occur in developing countries, there is very little data on the true prevalence of asthma and COPD in these countries. Chronic respiratory symptoms are common in the general population but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition. Factors contributing to low rates of diagnosis include limited access to, negative perceptions of, and lack of diagnostic capability in healthcare facilities. Determining the prevalence of asthma & COPD in the community has remained a challenge because of the poor sensitivity and specificity of the widely used questionnaire-based research tools, while spirometry, which is the gold standard diagnostic test, is a challenge to use in community-based epidemiological surveys. 

Informed by a scoping review of existing questionnaires and protocols used in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to identify CRDs, we conducted a pilot survey to explore feasibility of using screening process in four countries (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan). Our pilot findings will inform a future fully powered survey to determine the prevalence of asthma, COPD and other CRD in the community, using robust random sampling strategies, and quality assured spirometry undertaken by field workers.

Medical equipment is used to take the place of patients’ organs during their recovery.

Some critical care units are attached to condition-specific treatment units, such as heart, kidney, liver, breathing, circulation or nervous disorders. Others specialise in neonatal care (babies), paediatric care (children) or patients with severe injury or trauma.

Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken.

705,"Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) is a World Health Organization (WHO) approach in which community health workers deliver basic healthcare services in the community setting, including childhood pneumonia treatment.

The WHO pneumonia guidelines are sensitive but non-specific, in order to ensure that children with possible pneumonia receive antibiotic treatment. As a result, while the guidelines miss few children with pneumonia (high sensitivity), many children who do not have pneumonia incorrectly receive antibiotics (low specificity), resulting in antibiotic overuse.

The WHO guidelines do not include lung auscultation (listening to lung sounds) in their pneumonia definition for frontline healthcare workers, likely due to its high inter-observer variability, regardless of healthcare providers’ training level. Digital auscultation by electronic stethoscopes may help to overcome these limitations. Inclusion of lung auscultation in the current algorithm could enhance the specificity of the guidelines.

This study aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of child pneumonia by using automated lung sound classification through digital auscultation.

The embedded PhD will use the study data to (i) assess the consistency of lung sounds recorded by primary health care workers from under-five children using a digital stethoscope against pre-defined quality thresholds and (ii) determine the reliability and performance of the interpretations of recorded lung sounds by the Smartscope analysis system compared to reference interpretations by a paediatric listening panel.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population can serve as a useful measure of exposure and spread.To help plan key aspects of the public health response (e.g., shielding; eventual vaccination implementation strategies), decision-makers need regularly updated data on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and potential immunity) in the community. The rationale is that serial longitudinal seroepidemiological surveys can help to quantify and monitor the proportion of the population that has antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, providing information on the proportion of the population exposed and the cumulative incidence of infection in the population. Hence, there is a strategic need for data from serial sero-survey studies of SARS-CoV-2 in UK.

Trials have shown that using a bronchoscope to place endobronchial valves into the airways can be very effective in carefully selected patients and the technique is now being adopted in hospitals across the UK.

This study will collect data from people undergoing these procedures at hospitals across the UK to evaluate how well they work in practice and what factors at baseline influence response.

725,"Each year, an estimated 33.1 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections occur among under-five children globally, leading to 3.2 million hospitalisations and 118,200 deaths. The burden of RSV-associated severe acute lower respiratory tract infection is ten times higher in developing countries compared to that in developed countries (36.1 per 1000 life birth vs 3.2 per 1000 life birth, respectively). 

In addition to acute mortality and morbidity, RSV infection has a long-term effect on children’s health. RSV infection can induce a state of bronchial hyper-reactivity that has an association with the development of asthma in later life, which, in turn, is a significant risk factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood.

In this study, we are collecting longitudinal data of a group of 2,274 children aged between 6-8 years in three South Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  Among these children, 402 had RSV infection in their first two months of life; the remaining 1,873 children did not have such conditions at the same period confirmed by laboratory testing.

Health workers are routinely visiting households of eligible children. Children whose parents provided consent are visited three times in one year period, at baseline, after six months and the end of the year. In the first visit, a research assistant explained the study objectives and procedures to a family member (primarily the mother) of the eligible children to provide consent for enrolling the children in the study.  The parents of the consented children were being interviewed using a structured questionnaire to record the current and previous health status of children. The asthma sign and symptoms were recorded using a questionnaire designed following the International Study of Allergies and Asthma in Childhood (ISAAC). During the second and third visits, similar questionnaires of the first visit are being planned to use for data collection. All children are intended to assess by a research physician to record the physical growth, lung function, exercise tolerance, and blood eosinophil level.

Childhood renal tumour dataset

This document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 – 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification – the process by which each child is assigned to one of several ‘standard of care’ treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. 

It is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.

Data are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). 

F1 Registration information
F2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)
F3 Surgical form – operative findings
F4 Pathology form – institutional pathologist
F6 Post-operative chemotherapy
F11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form
F12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form – additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)
F15 Reference Pathology – “Central review”
F17 Treatment of relapse or progression
F18 Follow up form – for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.
F20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)
F20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)

Details of the content of each CRF are in the table below.

Most children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child’s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK’s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. 

The IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.

These trials’ primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse ‘late effects’ may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  

The IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.

Plans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. 

This project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient’s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England’s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE’s Office for Data Release.

NCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. 

Patient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. 

The project’s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.

For HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.

Cumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.

With the increased demand on acute care services there is a growing requirement for rapid laboratory results to facilitate the decision to discharge or admit, including the escalation of care. Laboratory turn around times (LTAT) are defined as the interval between when a test is requested to the time the results are available to the clinical team. LTAT is considered one of the most noticeable markers of a laboratory service and is often used as a key performance indicator in healthcare settings.

754,"Many patients admitted to hospital have multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs), also known as multimorbidity. Despite this, care delivery in hospital is designed for the treatment of single conditions. Often, the care of patients with multimorbidity can be unsatisfactory, inefficient and expensive.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with a high burden of co-morbidities which tend to co-exist in specific disease clusters. Recognising their presence enables holistic patient management, but also offers opportunities to identify common biological mechanisms across diseases which might be therapeutically targetable.    

The most common comorbidities in COPD include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and osteoporosis.  Often presentations are badged as exacerbations and alternative causes of breathlessness are missed.

CAP is associated with increased long-term mortality and loss of independence for older adults.  CAP typically affects older adults with co-morbidities- a group who have largely shielded throughout the winter period. This seems to have reduced rates of transmissible disease in vulnerable people. Complications such as sepsis, and empyema (infected fluid around the lung) prolong hospital admission, result in additional interventions in hospital and have higher mortality than CAP alone. The causative agents for CAP are often poorly identified in real world clinical practice.
These data allow the investigation of the different ways in which COVID-19 has impacted on existing health conditions, how often causative agents were identified in real-world practice and the sensitivities of the bacteria, which antibiotics were used and patient outcomes.

Dataset contains qualitative interviews from phase 2, responses to quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews in phase 3. 

Supported self-management for asthma (including action plans and regular review) is highly effective at improving asthma control, reducing acute attacks and the need for unscheduled healthcare. However, globally it is challenging to implement self-management in patients with asthma. One particular challenge is the need to tailor support for people with limited health literacy especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs) such as in Malaysia. In 2015,  it was estimated that more than 90% of the Malaysian general population have limited health literacy. A tailored asthma self-management intervention, paying attention to the needs of people with limited health literacy, potentially could lessen health inequalities in Malaysia. This study is conducted in 3 phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review looking at effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions which address health literacy needs. We found gap in this area of knowledge. In phase 2, we conducted mixed qualitative and Photovoice, an arts-based qualitative study to explore lived experience of people living with asthma and limited health literacy in Malaysia. We found rich data on challenges and enablers around psychosocial themes on how people views asthma, self-management and experienced health literacy.  We also explore the potential of technology i.e. mobile application to tailor asthma self-management support. Based on phase 2 findings, in phase 3, we developed and refined an asthma self-management mobile application with feedback from patients and health care professionals through a intervention design workshop which was conducted online.

Adult Critical Care (ACC) is a subset of APC data. An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or High Dependency Unit (HDU) ward in a hospital, known as a critical care unit, provides support, monitoring and treatment for critically ill patients requiring constant support and monitoring to maintain function in at least one organ, and often in multiple organs. Medical equipment is used to take the place of patients’ organs during their recovery.

Some critical care units are attached to condition-specific treatment units, such as heart, kidney, liver, breathing, circulation or nervous disorders. Others specialise in neonatal care (babies), paediatric care (children) or patients with severe injury or trauma.

Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver.

This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the HES data set.

HES data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:

private patients treated in NHS hospitals
patients resident outside of England
care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS
Each HES record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:

clinical information about diagnoses and operations
patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live
We apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published HES data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

Covering all the regions and nations of the UK, it has an initial sample of 39,802 households at Wave 1. Sample members are followed when they leave a household, and new people join the Study as they become part of existing sample member households.

Understanding Society has a number of unique design features. It covers the whole population, with boost samples to ensure it is representative of immigrant and ethnic minority groups, and its large sample enables sub-population groups to be examined. Researchers can use the household context to explore how lives link, and the relationships between family members. Its annual data collection means that changes in people’s lives are more accurately captured over time.

Information is collected directly from everyone aged over 10 years, with parents providing information on younger children. Understanding Society asks people about things like their home and family, work and school, health and wellbeing, financial situation and their social and political attitudes. The information people share helps us to understand what people think, feel and do. It also helps us see how society is changing over time. The Study covers everyone in a household, from children to adults, so researchers can understand the experiences of the whole family over time. By 2020, nine Waves of Understanding Society data were available, with 27 years of data available for a significant sub-group who were part of BHPS.

Early warning systems (EWS) are bedside tools used to assess basic physiological parameters to identify patients with potential or established critical illness. Evidence suggests that they may predict risk of intensive care admission, death and length of hospital stay. In 2017, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) published an updated National Early Warning Score, referred to as NEWS2, based upon six physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturations, temperature and level of consciousness). It is associated with specific clinical response recommendations in which a step change occurs at a threshold NEWS2 score >5, requiring an urgent clinical response no matter what the presenting complaint or condition.

800,"Emergency hospital admissions in the UK have been rising steadily. Medical emergencies account for the largest proportion of unplanned admissions.  Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) is one of many ways the NHS are working to provide the right care, in the right place and at the right time.  The national SDEC model builds on the previous work undertaken in ambulatory emergency care (AEC) services across the NHS , which was aimed at providing a consistent approach to patient pathways. 

A proportion of medical admissions are suitable for SDEC, where they are assessed and treated, but do not require overnight admission to an inpatient bed. This is beneficial for patients, as hospital admission and its associated risks can be avoided. As inpatient admissions increase, it is also important to consider alternative methods of care to reduce pressure on inpatient services. SDEC is highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan, recommending a third of patients in acute services should receive SDEC.

The number of medical patients receiving SDEC varies between centres. This may relate to local patient populations, but also local availability of services. SDEC is often delivered through Ambulatory Emergency Care, as well as the Acute Medical Unit, and multiple additional services can aid delivery, including hospital at home services, and early outpatient review in specialist clinics. These services vary between hospitals.

812,"Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) is a database containing details of all admissions, A and E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England.

Records in the HES Admitted Patient Care (APC) database are called ‘hospital episodes’, and each hospital episode relates to a period of care for a patient under a single consultant within one hospital provider. A stay in hospital from admission to discharge is called a ‘spell’ and can be made up of one or more episodes of care. HES APC looks at completed episodes, called Finished Admission Episodes (FAEs), which is the first episode in a spell of care, and Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs), which is a continuous period of care under one consultant.

Initially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver. 

This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the HES data set.

HES data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:

private patients treated in NHS hospitals
patients resident outside of England
care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS
Each HES record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:

clinical information about diagnoses and operations
patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live

Dataset 14.0
Version 1.0 15.2.2021

Background.
Acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Early treatment can have positive effects on long-term outcome. Non-invasive ventilation is commonly used for patients with respiratory failure during acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  For other patients, including neuromuscular dysfunction, mechanical ventilation may be needed. For refractory hypoxemia, new rescue therapies have emerged to help improve the oxygenation, and in some cases mortality. This dataset summarises the demography, admitting complaint, serial physiology, treatments and ventilatory strategies in patients admitted with hypoxaemia. Management options and rescue therapies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are included.

Growing Up in Bradford is a follow up to the initial Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort study. BiB was established to examine the determinants of health and development during childhood and throughout adult life, and recruited 12,453 mothers who experienced 13,858 births. The Growing Up study is the first full follow up of the cohort and aims to investigate the determinants of primary school aged children’s health and development, with a focus on both parents health and wellbeing and the exposure in childhood that may influence future health. The age of children included in this follow up are between seven and 11 years old.

**Recruitment process**

The study recruited from the pool of individuals who had taken part in the original BiB study, with as many mothers, partners and children from the original cohort recruited as possible. 6,502 children, 5,291 mothers and 826 partners completed the study.

**Available data**

Each child completed an age appropriate questionnaire, with one of the child’s parents completing a questionnaire about themselves and their partner and a separate questionnaire about their child. Topics included in the adults questionnaire included residential environment characteristics and satisfaction, socio-economic circumstances, social circumstances, and health and behaviour.  The adult completed child survey asked questions about their child’s health, development and behaviour. The child completed child questionnaire asked questions regarding physical activity and diet.

Two subsets of adults were asked further questions. One was asked additional questions regarding their child’s diet and physical activity, and the adult’s views on parenting.  The other was asked questions about their child’s experience of asthma and allergies.

Participants (adults and children) could also volunteer to provide a range of biological measures and samples. As a result, the Growing Up data also contains samples/results of blood tests, blood pressure reading, renal analyses and DEXA scans.",,
815,"The UK Parkinson’s Audit assesses care provided to people with Parkinson's by a range of clinical specialties against evidence-based guidelines.

The speech and language therapy audit includes services providing care to people specifically in connection with their Parkinson’s. Services submit data on their model of service delivery and the assessments which are routinely carried out (service audit) and data on the care provided over the last 12 months to at least ten of their consecutive patients seen during the five-month data collection period (patient audit). No patient identifiers are collected. 

The audit is open to services across the UK - secondary care (non-acute) and community services. A service is self-defined - for example an individual therapist or a group of therapists seeing the same cohort of patients. There can therefore be more than one service taking part in any Trust or setting.

The 2019 audit includes data from 79 speech and language therapy services covering 1022 patient cases.

The data is available by UK Parkinson’s Excellence Network region. The UK Parkinson's Excellence Network is a network of health and social care professionals working to improve Parkinson's services administered with support from Parkinson’s UK. Professionals can join the Network to access resources, increase their knowledge of Parkinson's and collaborate with people affected by Parkinson's to transform health and care services. 

The audit is the recognised quality improvement tool for the Excellence Network, providing an important baseline against which progress can be measured, informing national, regional and local service improvement priorities and plans to achieve better services for people living with the condition.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs’ flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility.

826,"The beginning of the 2020/2021 academic year across UK universities was followed by a sharp increase in the COVID-19 infection rates in a largely asymptomatic student population, which could only be monitored thanks to the decision of some Higher Education providers to establish in-house asymptomatic testing facilities. These services ran in parallel to UK Government’s surveillance efforts, which in turn relied mostly on self-referred symptomatic cases.

Appreciating the untapped potential contained in these highly controlled cohorts, the University of Nottingham, The University of Cambridge and Cardiff University created asymptomatic services with consent to research and future contact embedded in the sample collection workflow. Given the regional, demographic and living arrangements differences within and across these three universities, this consortium provides a unique opportunity to systematically collect samples and data that will prove invaluable in understanding the development of immunity against SARS-CoV2, through past and future immunological profile in this population. It will also enable studies on still underappreciated aspects of the infection, such as the impact of virus mutation on the development of the immune response.

839,"Nearly 340,000 older people in England live in residential or nursing care homes. Older people living in care homes often have complex health problems which make them more likely to need hospital care in hospital if their health suddenly deteriorates. People living in care homes account for 185,000 emergency admissions to hospital each year and spend over 1.46 million days in hospital beds. Improving care for older patients living in care homes will directly benefit patients while reducing the demand for hospital beds and reduce the risk of hospital overcrowding. 

A significant proportion of hospital admissions from care homes are unnecessary and could be avoided if their needs were addressed differently.  The hospital environment and can be distressing for some older people living in care homes and the burden of transferring patients from their home to hospital can be significant. These factors have driven a search for alternative ways of providing better care. 

This highly granular dataset of 128,000 admissions from care home provides a unique opportunity to understand reasons, pathways and outcomes from acute presentations to hospital.

PIONEER geography: The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. 

Electronic Heath Record. UHB is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & an expanded 250 ITU bed capacity during COVID. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.

Scope: Acute care episodes amongst patients aged over 65 from care homes. Longitudinal & individually linked, so that the preceding & subsequent health journey can be mapped & healthcare utilisation prior to & after admission understood. The dataset includes highly granular patient demographics, co-morbidities taken from ICD-10 & SNOMED-CT codes. Serial, structured data pertaining to process of care (timings, admissions, wards), presenting complaint, physiology readings (heart rate, BMI, blood pressure, respiratory rate, NEWS2 score, oxygen saturations and clinical frailty scale), Charlson comorbidity index, Lab analysis results(e.g. urea, albumin, platelets, white blood cells) microbiology results, procedures, outpatients admissions, oxygen delivery methods, drug administered and all outcomes. Linked images available (radiographs, CT scans, MRI).

Available supplementary data: Matched controls; ambulance, OMOP data, synthetic data.

843,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung condition characterised by progressive lung function limitation. COPD is an umbrella term and encompasses a spectrum of pathophysiologies including chronic bronchitis, small airways disease and emphysema. COPD caused an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide I each year, and is estimated to be the third leading cause of death worldwide. The British Lung Foundation (BLF) estimates that the disease costs the NHS around £1.9 billion per year. COPD is therefore a significant public health challenge. This dataset explores the impact of hospitalisation and service use in patients with COPD during the COVID pandemic.

844,"As respiratory infection is better controlled in Bangladesh, chronic respiratory diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, are emerging as the major health threat. This project aims to enhance access to pulmonary rehabilitation through implementation research in Bangladesh.

Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is proven to be the most effective strategy to improve shortness of breath, health status and exercise tolerance as well as reducing re-admissions and mortality in patients with recent exacerbations.

While PR uptake is significant in developed countries, in Bangladesh it is a relatively new intervention.

The aim of this PhD is to develop and pilot a PR programme that could be scaled up in Bangladesh.

845,"The Northern Ireland Mortality Dataset contains information on deaths registered in Northern Ireland (NI). The data is collected from death certificates and information provided by GPs and other Health and Social Care Northern Ireland (HSCNI) providers. The data is provided with a three month delay from the date of registration and the information will relate to the latest certificate. This means the cause of death for an individual may be updated in cases where the death undergoes  further investigation, for example by a coroner. The data can be linked to other health-related datasets using patient Health and Care Number (HCN). HCN is not usually supplied along with death certificate data. This is added after matching to medical records, meaning that not all records will have a HCN to allow linkage to other health datasets.",,
